# User Registration Process Flowchart

## Process Description
This flowchart details the user registration process for the Airbnb Clone application, covering both guest and host registration paths.

## Key Steps in the Process

### 1. Registration Initiation
- User accesses registration page
- Chooses role: Guest or Host
- Enters basic information (email, password, personal details)

### 2. Validation Checks
- Email format validation
- Password strength validation
- Required field validation
- Unique email check (no duplicate accounts)

### 3. Account Creation
- Data sanitization and encryption
- User record creation in database
- Role assignment (guest/host)
- Profile initialization

### 4. Email Verification
- Verification email generation and sending
- Verification link with expiration
- Email service integration

### 5. Completion & Redirection
- Success confirmation
- Automatic login upon verification
- Role-specific dashboard redirection

## Decision Points
- **Invalid Input**: Return validation errors
- **Duplicate Email**: Prompt user to login or recover account
- **Email Verification Failed**: Allow resend verification
- **Timeout**: Handle session expiration

## Error Handling
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Log technical errors for debugging
- Maintain data integrity on failures

## Success Metrics
- Registration completion rate
- Time to complete registration
- Verification email open rate
- Failed registration analysis
